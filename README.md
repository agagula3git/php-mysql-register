# PHP - Complete registration system with the page accessible only to logged-in users
A complete user registration system using PHP and MySQL database.

## General Info
  
By developing this interesting project I went through the complete process of creating a user registration system where users can create an account by providing username, email and password. If users that attempt to log in to the database provide the correct data, they'll be redirected to their own page with the personal data. That page is accessible only to logged-in users.  
When trying to register an account, you need to enter the hashed password for security reasons. You are required to re-enter your password and email as well. Your email and password go through a complete verification.
